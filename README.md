# Local Products Rest API üöÄ

A basic REST API using express, node and sequelize.

The requirements are that the API should have the functionality necessary in order to Get, Post, Update (Put/Patch) and Delete.

The basic tables the database has are Products and Brands.

This is the simulation of database contracted for local business. No aspects of front end were required for this project.
